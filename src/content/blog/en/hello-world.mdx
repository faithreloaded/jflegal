Welcome to the new blog system. This is a dummy post in English.

## Welcome to the New System

This is a fully functional blog system built with Astro and MDX. It allows you to create rich content with integrated components and complete multi-language support.

### Key Features

## MDX

You can write content in MDX and include components if needed. The system is designed to be flexible and easy to use.

### Folder Structure

The blog system is organized in a very simple way:

```
src/content/blog/
├── en/           # English posts
│   └── hello-world.mdx
└── es/           # Spanish posts
    └── hola-mundo.mdx
```

### Language Configuration

Each post has translation metadata that enables navigation between languages:

```javascript
// In each post's frontmatter
---
title: "Hello World"
date: 2025-10-05
excerpt: "A test entry in English"
translations:
  es: "hola-mundo"  # Slug of the Spanish post
---
```

### Routing System

Routes are automatically generated based on the folder structure:

```javascript
// Automatically generated routes
/es/blog/hola-mundo    // Spanish post
/en/blog/hello-world   // English post
/es/blog              // Spanish posts list
/en/blog              // English posts list
```

### Components and Styles

```javascript
// Blog card component
<BlogCard 
  title={post.data.title}
  excerpt={post.data.excerpt}
  date={post.data.date}
  image={post.data.image}
  slug={post.slug}
