    "q4": {
      "question": "When should I incorporate a company instead of being self-employed?",
      "answer": "The decision depends on several factors: if your business has growth prospects, you need partners, you seek asset protection or require greater financial flexibility, a company may be more convenient. We advise you to choose the legal form that best suits your profile and business objectives."

    "q5": {
