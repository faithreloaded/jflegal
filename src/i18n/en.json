      "question": "How long do I have to settle the Inheritance Tax?",
      "answer": "The Inheritance Tax must be settled and filed within 6 months after the date of death of the deceased, although a 6-month extension can be requested. It is important not to exceed these deadlines to avoid penalties or late payment interest."

      "question": "What is the Beckham Law and who can apply for it?",
      "answer": "The Beckham Law allows foreign workers who move to Spain for work reasons to access more beneficial taxation (24% up to €600,000, 47% from there). It requires having been a tax resident outside Spain for the last 5 years, having an employment contract in Spain and residing more than 183 days a year."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "When should I incorporate a company instead of being self-employed?",
      "answer": "The decision depends on several factors: if your business has growth prospects, you need partners, you seek asset protection or require greater financial flexibility, a company may be more convenient. We advise you to choose the legal form that best suits your profile and business objectives."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What is the deadline to claim the legitimate share in Catalonia?",
      "answer": "In Catalonia, the deadline to claim the legitimate share is 10 years from the date of death of the deceased or from when the heir discovers they have been disinherited. After this period, the claim becomes time-barred and cannot be judicially enforced."
